# Cup Champs 19

I've been devoted to the St. Louis Blues for as long as I can remember. We've been fighting for the Stanley Cup every year since our first year as a team, in 1967. Two years later, in 1969, we took our first shot at winning the Cup in the finals but unfortunately did not come out on top. Now, after 50 years and some of the hardest skating I've ever seen, the Blues have wont their first Cup, and hopefully not their last.

## Goals
When we won Wednesday night, I knew I wanted to create a small app that was a tribute to the team who's worked so hard this season and every other season. I created a wireframe for myself and accumulated the data, then gave myself 3 hours to complete the project. I completed in about 90 minutes.
